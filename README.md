# SBC

## Easily calculate SBC plots from prior and posterior samples.

---
### Currently supports:

* Rank Histogram
* ECDF plot
* Centered Histogram plot

---
### TODO:
* Uniformity checks
* More envelope metrics
* Add verbose diagnostics(somewhat like get\_hmc\_diagnostics)
* Refine SBCData for better support
* **Automate prior and posterior sampling**
* Inferential Calibration
